Manual of Yeste 1.2.6
=====================

Yeste is an easy-to-use, in-progress wxPython notebook application.

The GUI is made as succinct as possible so it's necessary to list
the less-obvious features here:

- Directories

  A note will turn into a directory when its name is sufixed with ":dir".
  When this happens, the content of the note, if there is any, will serve
  as the password of the new directory.
  
- Editting

  Click on a note to select it, and double click to edit. Press Esc to
  exit editting and save the note. Use Shift or Ctrl for multiple selection.
  Press Enter to edit more than entries at one time. Right click on the list
  to open up the  Cut-Copy-Paste menu. You can first Cut/Copy selected items,
  and later Paste them in other directories.
