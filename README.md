Manual of Yeste 1.2.7
=====================

Yeste is an easy-to-use, in-progress wxPython notebook application.

The GUI is made as succinct as possible so it's necessary to list
the less-obvious features here:

- Directories

  A note will turn into a directory when its name is sufixed with ":dir".
  When this happens, the content of the note, if there is any, will serve
  as the password of the new directory.
  
- Editting

  - Click to select
  - Double click to edit
  - Press Del to delete
  - Press Esc to exit editting and save
  - Shift/Ctrl for multiple selection
  - Press Enter to edit more than entries at one time
  - Right click to open up the Cut-Copy-Paste menu
  - Click on URLs to navigate in a browser
