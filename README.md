Manual of Yeste 1.2.1
=====================

Yeste is an easy-to-use, in-progress wxPython notebook application.

The GUI is made as succinct as possible so it's necessary to list
the less-obvious features here:

- Directories

  A note will turn into a directory when its name is prefixed with "dir:".
  When this happens, the content of the note, if there is any, will serve
  as the password of the new directory.
  
- Editting

  Click on a note to select it, and double click to edit. Use Shift or
  Ctrl for multiple selection. Right click on the list to open up the
  Cut-Copy-Paste menu. You can first Cut/Copy selected items, and
  later Paste them in other directories.
